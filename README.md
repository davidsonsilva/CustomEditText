"# CustomEditText" 

Android offers a large set of View subclasses, such as Button, TextView, EditText, ImageView, CheckBox, or RadioButton. You can use these subclasses to construct a UI that enables user interaction and displays information in your app. If the View subclasses don't meet your needs, you can create a custom view that does.

After you create a custom view, you can add it to different layouts in the same way you would add a TextView or Button. This lesson shows you how to create and use custom views based on View subclasses.
