# CustomEditText 

###### Android offers a large set of View subclasses, such as Button, TextView, EditText, ImageView, CheckBox, or RadioButton. You can use these subclasses to construct a UI that enables user interaction and displays information in your app. If the View subclasses don't meet your needs, you can create a custom view that does.

###### After you create a custom view, you can add it to different layouts in the same way you would add a TextView or Button. This lesson shows you how to create and use custom views based on View subclasses.

## What you should already KNOW

You should be able to:

- Create and run apps in Android Studio.
- Use the Layout Editor to create a UI.
- Edit a layout in XML.
- Use touch, text, and click listeners in your code.

### What you will LEARN

You will learn how to:

- Extend the [View](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html)  subclass [EditText](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/EditText.html) to create a custom text-editing view.
- Use listeners to handle user interaction with the custom view.
- e a custom view in a layout.

### What you will DO

- Add a new class that extends the EditText class to create a custom view.
- Use listeners to provide the custom view's behavior.
- Add the custom view to a layout.

## App overview

The CustomEditText app demonstrates how to extend EditText to make a custom text-editing view. The custom view includes a clear (X) button for clearing text. After the custom view is created, you can use multiple versions of it in layouts, applying different EditText attributes as needed.
